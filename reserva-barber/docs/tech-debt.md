### T1 — Client-side recovery from a missing Server Action
**Status:** deferred · **Effort:** ~1–2 h · **Owner story:** none (cross-cutting)

Pinning `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` keeps Server Action ids stable across deploys, so the
`"Server action not found"` dead end should no longer occur in the normal workflow. Three cases remain
uncovered: **renaming an action, moving its file, or a build that ships without the key.** In any of
those, an already-open tab still meets an unrecoverable error screen.

The safety net is a client-side handler that recognises the error and reloads the page **once** —
turning a dead end into a flicker.

- **Where:** a `global-error.tsx` (the login page has no error boundary of its own today) plus the
  existing `app/(dashboard)/error.tsx`, sharing a tested predicate.
- **The hazard to design around:** a reload loop. If the error survives the reload, reloading again
  makes the app unusable — worse than the bug. Guard with a one-shot `sessionStorage` flag and cover
  the "already reloaded" path with a test.
- **Trigger:** any recurrence of `"Server action not found"` in production, or before shipping the
  public booking flow — whichever comes first.

### T2 — Password policy is documented but not enforced
**Status:** **needs a human** · **Effort:** ~2 min

`docs/data-model.md` §1 requires a 12-character minimum. That rule lives in Supabase, not in this
codebase, and **has not been applied yet**: Authentication → Policies → minimum password length.
Until then the provider's default (6) is what actually protects the only administrative account.

- **Trigger:** now. Nothing depends on it, which is exactly why it will be forgotten.

### T3 — Login UI behaviours not covered by the component tests
**Status:** partially closed by M1 · **Effort:** ~5 min in a browser

M1 installed React Testing Library + jsdom (design D4), which now covers the equivalent
behaviours **on the location forms**: pending-state disabling, `aria-live` + focus on the error
region, and value preservation after a rejection. The login page itself was not retested, and one
item cannot be covered by jsdom at all:

- **a failed login answers `200` with form state, never `401`** — this is a property of the HTTP
  response, which jsdom does not produce. It needs a real request (browser, `curl`, or the
  Playwright suite that was considered and declined in M1).

- **Trigger:** the next time the login page is touched for any reason, or if an E2E runner is ever
  added.

### T7 — The login form very likely clears the email on a failed attempt
**Status:** **needs a decision** · **Effort:** ~20 min

`openspec/specs/owner-authentication/spec.md` requires that after a failed login "the email value is
preserved, the password is cleared". M1 discovered that **React 19 resets an uncontrolled form once
its action resolves** — the location form lost both fields for exactly this reason, caught by the
first component test written against it (`LocationForm.test.tsx`). `app/login/LoginForm.tsx` uses the
same pattern: uncontrolled inputs plus `useActionState`. If the behaviour is identical there, A1
does not meet its own spec, and the `passwordResetKey` remount that clears the password is
redundant work guarding something React already does.

The fix is the one M1 applied: echo the submitted email back in the action's state and render it as
`defaultValue`.

- **Not fixed in M1** deliberately: it belongs to the `owner-authentication` spec, and changing
  shipped behaviour of a closed change without updating its artifacts would violate the spec-first
  policy (`docs/base-standards.md` §7).
- **Trigger:** confirm it in a browser first — one failed login answers the question. If confirmed,
  it is a bug against an existing requirement, not debt, and should be scheduled as its own change.

### T8 — Concurrent edits to the same location silently overwrite each other
**Status:** accepted · **Effort:** ~2 h if it becomes real

M1 ships no version column and no `updatedAt` precondition on the location update (design D5). Two
sessions editing the same location means the later save discards the earlier one with a success
message and no warning.

Accepted because the system has exactly one administrative user, and adding conflict resolution to a
two-field form would cost more than the failure it prevents.

- **Trigger:** M2. Once barbers are attached to locations, a location name becomes load-bearing for
  staffing and silent loss stops being harmless. Also revisit if a second `Owner` ever exists.

### T10 — No background utility resolves on an `<a>` element
**Status:** **needs investigation** · **Effort:** ~1 h to diagnose, unknown to fix

Verified in the browser during M1: `bg-primary` and `bg-muted` paint a `<div>` and a `<span>`, and
**never** an `<a>` — the anchor computes `background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0)` with the class present in
its `classList`. The first casualty was M1's "Nueva sucursal" call to action, which rendered as dark
text on a dark background (`text-primary-foreground` resolved, the background did not) and was
effectively invisible.

Root cause not found. No rule in any readable stylesheet gives an anchor a background or suppresses
one, and the `.bg-primary` rule itself is not enumerable from the page — so the stylesheet that
defines it is not fully accessible to the inspecting extension. That is where the next attempt should
start: read the generated CSS from the build output rather than from the live DOM.

**Worked around in M1**, not fixed: the create control puts the variant classes on an inner `<span>`
inside the `<Link>`. Any future link-styled-as-button hits the same wall.

- **Trigger:** the next story that needs a link to look like a button — P1's public profile and D1's
  dashboard home both will. Fix it before the workaround is copied a third time.

### T11 — Cross-owner isolation has no executable proof
**Status:** **needs a test when it becomes possible** · **Effort:** ~1 h

Ownership scoping is the security boundary of the whole dashboard: `findByIdForOwner`, the scoped
`update`, and every list query carry `ownerId` so another owner's row resolves as not-found. All of
it is asserted **only by unit tests against a mocked Prisma client**, which verify the *shape of the
call* — that `ownerId` appears in the `where` — not that Prisma actually honours a compound
predicate on `update`.

It cannot be proven end-to-end today, and that is not an oversight: `data-persistence` → "Exactly one
Owner" forbids a second `Owner` row, and no application path may create one. With a single owner
there is no exposure — every row belongs to the only owner there is. The gap is in the *assurance*,
not in the behaviour.

- **Trigger:** the moment a second `Owner` becomes possible — multi-tenancy, a dedicated test project
  with its own owner, or any change that relaxes "Exactly one Owner". Before that ships, add an
  integration test against a real database with two owners covering: list scoping, a foreign id
  resolving to `null`, and a scoped update affecting zero rows.

### T12 — A double submit can report a successful creation as a duplicate
**Status:** accepted · **Effort:** ~1 h if it becomes real

The `location-management` spec claims the second of two rapid submissions "does not present the
successful outcome as a failure". Data integrity is never at risk — the `(ownerId, name)` constraint
guarantees exactly one row, which is the point of having it. But when two identical creates race
**before hydration** (so the disabled-submit state does not yet exist), one wins and the other is
rejected by the constraint, rendering "Ya tenés una sucursal con ese nombre." The owner created a
location and may be told it already exists.

Verification 8.12 observed the benign outcome — three rapid clicks produced one row and showed the
redirect — but that was after hydration, and which response the browser commits is a race.

A candidate fix is to treat a constraint violation on create as success when the existing row already
matches what was submitted, redirecting instead of erroring. That deserves thought before it is
written: it makes "create" quietly idempotent, which is helpful here and would be wrong elsewhere.

- **Trigger:** any report of that message appearing right after a successful create — or the arrival
  of the public booking flow (B4–B6), where the same double-submit shape carries a deposit and the
  stakes stop being cosmetic.

### T9 — Case-variant location names can both survive a race
**Status:** accepted · **Effort:** ~30 min

The uniqueness guarantee is the database constraint on `(ownerId, name)`, which is byte-exact. The
case-insensitive check that turns a duplicate into a friendly field error runs in the application, in
a separate round trip (design D2). Two submissions of "Centro" and "centro" interleaving closely
enough can therefore both be accepted.

The airtight fix is a unique index on `(ownerId, lower(name))`, rejected because Prisma cannot express
an expression index in `schema.prisma` and every later `prisma migrate dev` would report drift that
is not drift.

- **Trigger:** a second `Owner`, or any report of duplicate-looking locations in production.

### T4 — Owner email hardcoded in a committed migration
**Status:** **needs a decision** · **Effort:** ~0 (accept) or ~30 min (parameterise)

`prisma/migrations/*_add_owner_and_location_fk/migration.sql` contains the owner's real address, and
the repository is on GitHub. Impact is limited — the same address already appears as the author of
every commit — and changing it now needs a fresh migration because the row exists in production.

- **Trigger:** if the repository is public **and** the address should not be. Otherwise close this as
  accepted.

### T5 — Development still runs on Windows
**Status:** deferred · **Effort:** ~1 h

OpenNext states plainly that Windows is not fully supported, and this project has already paid for it
twice: builds fail without Developer Mode, and `patches/@opennextjs+cloudflare+1.20.1.patch` exists
solely to fix a Windows path-separator bug (`docs/s0-versions-decision.md`, findings 1–3). **A patched
dependency is a standing liability** — the next adapter upgrade may silently break it.

Moving development to WSL removes that entire class of problem and lets the patch be deleted. It also
matches how the code is actually built for production, which is Linux.

- **Trigger:** an `@opennextjs/cloudflare` upgrade, or the next Windows-only build failure.
- **Note:** the project must live in the Linux filesystem (`~/…`), not under `/mnt/c/…` — crossing
  filesystems makes installs and builds several times slower.

### T6 — Platform decision: Cloudflare vs Vercel
**Status:** **decided — stay on Cloudflare**, revisit on trigger

Evaluated on 2026-08-05 after repeated infrastructure friction. Staying, because the strongest argument
for migrating — deployment skew breaking Server Actions — turned out to be solvable on Cloudflare for
free, and because Cloudflare's free tier permits commercial use while Vercel's Hobby plan does not
(this app charges deposits, so Vercel would cost ~US$20/month, against a documented ~$0 budget).
Vercel Hobby is additionally unable to run story **B7**, whose cron must fire every few minutes.

Revisit if **any** of these happens:

- deployment skew recurs in production **with the key pinned**
- an adapter upgrade breaks the build and the patch no longer applies
- the Mercado Pago webhook flow hits a `workerd` limitation
- two consecutive stories spend more time on infrastructure than on product

That last one is the honest criterion: for a solo developer, velocity is the scarcest resource.
